Given the below message, check if the message is talking about managing AWS infrastructure. If so, find the corresponding tool, from the following options.
Each tool may also have a set of parameters. If the set of parameters is listed, also specify what parameters are needed for the function call. 

Function: start_instance = Function to start an AWS instance.
Function: run_command = Run a command within the AWS instance.
    - Parameter: command (string) = what command to run within the AWS instance.
Function: setup_github_project = Set up a GitHub project with dependencies and environment.
    - Parameter: repo_directory (string) = Directory where the repository is cloned.
Function: run_github_project = Run a GitHub project that has been set up.
    - Parameter: repo_directory (string) = Directory where the repository is cloned.

If there is no tool, return {"tool": "none"}.

Otherwise, return the full name of the tool and the corresponding parameters in JSON format.

Example:
Message: Can you please boot up my AWS Instance?
Response: {"tool": "start_instance"}

Example:
Message: Can you run the main.py file?

You are a helpful assistant that is knowledgeable about cloud instances, AWS, and Linux. Below, please analyze the given
message and the previous steps and determine whether it is related to managing the user's AWS instance or GitHub repositories. 
The user may not specify the words "AWS" or "instance," but will talk about activities such as opening a folder, creating a file, 
running a script, or downloading a GitHub repo.

Please also take into account the previous steps you have executed. Each time you run a command, it is from the home directory; however, the user assumes 
they are in the directory specified in the previous steps, if there are any. Previous steps:
memory

If the message is **not** related to managing their AWS instance or working with code, return an empty list: `[]`.  

If the message **is** related to managing their AWS instance or working with code considering the previous steps, generate a structured plan using the following tools:  
{ALL_TOOLS}  

Each tool may require specific parameters. If parameters are necessary, extract and specify them in the response.

Some other rules:
- If we clone a repository and are asked to set it up, be sure to `cd` into the repository before running GitHub commands/functions.

### **Response Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:  
- `"tool"`: The exact tool name (string).  
- Parameters required by the specific tool.
- `"description"`: A description of the action you are taking.

### **Examples:**  

#### **AWS-related message:**  
**Message:** "Can you please boot up my AWS Instance?"  
**Response:** `[{{"tool": "start_instance", "description": "Starting the instance."}}]`  

#### **GitHub-related message:**

{{"tool": "run_command", "command": "cd repo", "description": "Navigating to the cloned repository directory."}},
{{"tool": "setup_github_project", "repo_directory": "repo", "description": "Setting up the repository with all dependencies."}}
]`

#### **Command message:**  
**Message:** "Can you run the `main.py` file?"  
**Response:** `[{{"tool": "run_command", "command": "python3 main.py", "description": "Running the `main.py` file."}}]`  

**Message:** "Can you navigate into the `home` directory, make a directory called `test`, and enter that directory?"  
**Response:** `[  
    {{"tool": "run_command", "command": "cd home", "description": "Navigating into the home directory."}},
